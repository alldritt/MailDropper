# Mail Dropper

Mail Dropper is a prototype for a tool allowing Shortcuts workflows to operate on email messages.  

This version is **very** limited:

- it does not support multi-part messages
- it invokes a shortcut named "Porocess Email"

The code that makes this all happen is very crude but demonstrates how to do it.
